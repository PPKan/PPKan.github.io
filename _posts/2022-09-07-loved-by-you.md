# Loved By You - Milet

Have you ever felt empty inside when you wanna laugh  
But I'm not gonna rely on medication  
Holding my breath I'm not scared to be lonely  

在想笑的時候，你可曾感到空虛  
而我不打算仰賴藥物  
屏住呼吸。我並不害怕孤獨  

Have you ever cried without really knowing why?  
Is this our final song?  
No I don't need a reason to give up  
'Cause you're the best thing that happened in my life  

你可曾毫無頭緒地哭泣  
這一首是我們最後的歌嗎  
不，我不需要理由放棄  
"因你是我生命中有過最美好的事  

Then is this what I truly wanted  
Get out of my head right now  
The memories of us still haunt me every night  

這就是我真正需要的  
馬上滾出我的腦袋  
我們的回憶依舊每晚向我襲來  

I am the one who loved the most  
But now I have nothing  
Was I ever loved by you?  
You were really happy, weren't you?  

我曾是你最愛的人  
但如今我什麼都不剩  
你有愛過我嗎？  
你曾是那麼快樂的，不是嗎？  

I wish that my whole life is a fucking dream I'm such a soppy  
Was I ever loved by you?  
Is it too late to say I love you?  
You were mine  
Damn, I know I know  
We lost
We're alone

我願我的人生像一場該死的夢，我這個小丑。  
你有愛過我嗎？  
現在說我愛你還來得及嗎？  
我曾擁有你
該死，我就知道  
我們失去方向  
我們孑然一身  

Dancing with your shadow  
I ain't got nowhere to go  
Don't wanna drink myself to sleep anymore  
It has no taste  
And it's like our days, babe  

與你的身影共舞  
我哪裡都不去  
再也不想以酒入眠  
酒是那麼地無味  
而且這就像我們的那些日子，親愛的  

Reading all the texts you sent me like every day  
It's so unfair (but you were great)  
I wish you had the same dream as mine  
Someone tell me it will be alright  

閱讀那些你之前每天傳來的訊息  
真的太不公平了 (但你很棒)  
希望你跟我有同樣的夢  
希望有人告訴我一切都會沒事的  

Then is this what I truly wanted  
Get out of my head right now  
The memories of us still haunt me every night  

這就是我真正需要的  
馬上滾出我的腦袋  
我們的回憶依舊每晚向我襲來  

I am the one who loved the most  
But now I have nothing  
Was I ever loved by you?  
You were really happy, weren't you?  

我曾是你最愛的人  
但如今我什麼都不剩  
你有愛過我嗎？  
你曾是那麼快樂的，不是嗎？  

I wish that my whole life is a fucking dream I'm such a soppy  
Was I ever loved by you?  
Is it too late to say I love you?  
You were mine  
Damn, I know I know  
We lost
We're alone

我願我的人生像一場該死的夢，我這個小丑。  
你有愛過我嗎？  
現在說我愛你還來得及嗎？  
我曾擁有你
該死，我就知道  
我們失去方向  
我們孑然一身  

Damn, I know I know  
We lost
We're alone

該死，我就知道  
我們失去方向  
我們孑然一身
