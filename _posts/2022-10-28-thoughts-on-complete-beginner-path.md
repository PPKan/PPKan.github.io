# TryHackMe - Some thoughts after finishing Complete Beginner Path

> Announcement:  
This path is considered **deprecated** few months ago, and I just knew it this morning, so if you're new to THM, do Jr. Pentester path instead.

> TL;DR:  
Complete Beginner Path is nice, but some of the contents are hard to follow if you're a complete beginner. You may need to read some walkthroughs and find other sources instead of finishing the room with only the room content.

I've been learning on THM over a month, and the path I chose is the suggested paths, which are pre security, and introduction to cybersecurity. They are both great fundamental paths about some essential knowledge you must know, but right here I would just talk about the complete beginner path.

As the announcement said, the path is deprecated. The reason that I chose it is simply the thought of building up basic skills, and some suggestions from the old reddit posts. It's also my bad not to look deep inside the room content. 

The complete beginner path is basically telling you to try everything a little bit. The idea it self is not bad, but sometimes you may feel it's not very well organized. Just take an example about the web hacking session here, the room is like, hey, if you want to complete these rooms you must learn gobuster first, if you want to complete another room you must learn shell first. There's a lot of "jumping" going on here, and it feel I have already complete alot more rooms than this path listed.

At the perspective of learning, which is not bad, but it definitely make you feel longlasting and frustrating after you see there's still so many things need to learn to move on. I personally think the Jr. Pentester path have sloved this, I will go try it after a while. As you may see in the Jr. Pentester path, the path is more organized. The essential tools like burpsuite, nmap, gobuster have separated into few rooms, and you don't see some crazy challenge like rick or owsap juice shop in that path. It's fine for me to get daunting on some of them, but there's lots of people new to it might not able to accept such hardcore content in the complete beginner path. So GOOD JOB for THM team.

As previously said, the room contains lots of content, I was preparing to do a brush-up in this post before I saw the JR. path, I think I'll just do the JR path for the brush-up and see if there's something fundamental I'm missing out from the complete beginner's path. 

But yeah, I still enjoy the path and definitely learn some stuffs funny and useful. It contains things that people are not able to get from other paths like crptography, but IMO it's not worth is to do the path just for that.

About my future learning route, I'll have a glance on eJPT to see what I'm missing, and I'll keep my feet on the Jr. Pentester path and contiuning on the Red Teaming / Offensive security paths further on. I would also like to try the defence one since I had lots of fun in the wireshark room. BTW, the complete beginner path didn't cover much about defence except wireshark haha.

That's all about my rough thoughts on Complete Beginner Path, feel free to have a chat with me or leave a comment below I'll be much appretiated. See you then.
