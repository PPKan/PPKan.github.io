# TryHackMe - Some thoughts after finishing Complete Beginner Path

> Post updated 2022/11/1  
The Update make the post looking messy. The main idea is JR. Pentester is not good as I thought before.

> Alert:
This path is considered **deprecated** by the THM team; however, after I have a few rooms in JR. Pentester path, I do not think the jr. pentester path is good for beginners desipte the content are more concentrated, but it covers too much difficult stuffs at the beginning. So, I'll suggest complete beginner's path for now. And I'll make my own suggestion after I finish JR. Pentester path after a while then.

> TL;DR:  
Complete Beginner Path is great, but some of the contents are hard to follow if you're a complete beginner. You may need to read some walkthroughs and find other sources instead of finishing the room with only the room content.

I've been learning on THM over a month, and the path I chose is the suggested paths, which are pre security, and introduction to cybersecurity. They are both great fundamental paths about some essential knowledge you must know, but right here I would just talk about the complete beginner path.

As the announcement said, the path is deprecated. The reason that I chose it is simply the thought of building up basic skills, and some suggestions from the old reddit posts. But actually the result of learning this path turns out fabulous.

The complete beginner path is basically telling you to try everything a little bit. The idea it self is not bad, but sometimes it's normal to feel it's not very well organized. Just take an example about the web hacking session here, the room is like, hey, if you want to complete these rooms you must learn gobuster first, if you want to complete another room you must learn shell first. There's a lot of "jumping" going on here, and it feel I have already complete alot more rooms than this path listed.

At the perspective of learning, which is not bad, but it definitely make you feel longlasting and frustrating after you see there's still so many things need to learn to move on.  

Yeah, I've tried the JR. pentester path for few days, and that turns out not so good so I modified this post emergently. The JR. pentester path have great contents, but it is basically built on top of some knowledge on enumeration or webshells. It is definitely not possible to get through the path comfortably after finishing the two short suggested easy paths.

The JR. pentester for me right now is more like a plus alpha to the complete beginner's path with some stuffs overlapped. There's more pratical questions which is great for someone who have finished the fundamentals.

I do enjoied the complete beginner's path and definitely learn some stuffs funny and useful. It contains things that people are not able to get from other paths like crptography. There's is some rooms that could be modified furtherly, but so far this path is the best for beginners.

About my future learning route, I'll have a glance on eJPT to see what I'm missing, and I'll keep my feet on the Jr. Pentester path and contiuning on the Red Teaming / Offensive security paths further on. I would also like to try the defence one since I had lots of fun in the wireshark room. BTW, the complete beginner path didn't cover much about defence except wireshark haha.

That's all about my rough thoughts on Complete Beginner Path, feel free to have a chat with me or leave a comment below I'll be much appretiated. See you then.
